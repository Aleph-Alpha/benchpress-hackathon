    "question": "A format for expressing an ordered list of integers is to use a comma separated list of either\n\n* individual integers\n* or a range of integers denoted by the starting integer separated from the end integer in the range by a dash, '-'. The range includes all integers in the interval including both endpoints.  It is not considered a range unless it spans at least 3 numbers. For example \"12,13,15-17\"\n\nComplete the solution  so that it takes a list of integers in increasing order and returns a correctly formatted string in the range format. \n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\nsolution([-6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20])\n# returns \"-6,-3-1,3-5,7-11,14,15,17-20\"\n```\n\n```C#\nRangeExtraction.Extract(new[] {-6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20});\n# returns \"-6,-3-1,3-5,7-11,14,15,17-20\"\n```\n\n*Courtesy of rosettacode.org*",
