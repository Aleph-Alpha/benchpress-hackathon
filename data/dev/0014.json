    "question": "My little sister came back home from school with the following task:\ngiven a squared sheet of paper she has to cut it in pieces\nwhich, when assembled, give squares the sides of which form\nan increasing sequence of numbers.\nAt the beginning it was lot of fun but little by little we were tired of seeing the pile of torn paper.\nSo we decided to write a program that could help us and protects trees.\n\n## Task\n\nGiven a positive integral number n, return a **strictly increasing** sequence (list/array/string depending on the language) of numbers, so that the sum of the squares is equal to n\u00b2.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions (and there will be), return as far as possible the result with the largest possible values:\n\n## Examples\n\n`decompose(11)` must return `[1,2,4,10]`. Note that there are actually two ways to decompose 11\u00b2,\n11\u00b2 = 121 = 1 + 4 + 16 + 100 = 1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 + 10\u00b2 but don't return `[2,6,9]`, since 9 is smaller than 10.\n\nFor `decompose(50)` don't return `[1, 1, 4, 9, 49]` but `[1, 3, 5, 8, 49]` since `[1, 1, 4, 9, 49]`\ndoesn't form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\n## Note\nNeither `[n]` nor `[1,1,1,\u2026,1]` are valid solutions. If no valid solution exists, return `nil`, `null`, `Nothing`, `None` (depending on the language) or `\"[]\"` (C) ,`{}` (C++), `[]` (Swift, Go).\n\nThe function \"decompose\" will take a positive integer n \nand return the decomposition of N = n\u00b2 as:\n\n- [x1 ... xk]\nor\n- \"x1 ... xk\"\nor\n- Just [x1 ... xk]\nor\n- Some [x1 ... xk]\nor\n- {x1 ... xk}\nor\n- \"[x1,x2, ... ,xk]\"\n\ndepending on the language (see \"Sample tests\")\n\n# Note for Bash\n```\ndecompose 50 returns \"1,3,5,8,49\"\ndecompose 4  returns \"Nothing\"\n```\n# Hint\n\nVery often `xk` will be `n-1`.",
