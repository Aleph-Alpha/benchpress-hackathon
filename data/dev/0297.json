    "question": "Consider the following array:\n\n```\n[1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1234567, 12345678, 123456789, 12345678910, 1234567891011...]\n```\n\nIf we join these blocks of numbers, we come up with an infinite sequence which starts with `112123123412345123456...`. The list is infinite.\n\nYou will be given an number (`n`) and your task will be to return the element at that index in the sequence, where `1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^18`. Assume the indexes start with `1`, not `0`.  For example:\n\n```\nsolve(1) = 1, because the first character in the sequence is 1. There is no index 0. \nsolve(2) = 1, because the second character is also 1.\nsolve(3) = 2, because the third character is 2.\n```\n\nMore examples in the test cases. Good luck!",
