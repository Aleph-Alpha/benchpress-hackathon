    "question": "# Task\n You are a magician. You're going to perform a trick.\n\n You have `b` black marbles and `w` white marbles in your magic hat, and an infinite supply of black and white marbles that you can pull out of nowhere. \n \n You ask your audience to repeatedly remove a pair of marbles from your hat and, for each pair removed, you add one marble to the hat according to the following rule until there is only 1 marble left. \n\n If the marbles of the pair that is removed are of the same color, you add a white marble to the hat. Otherwise, if one is black and one is white, you add a black marble.\n \n Given the initial number of black and white marbles in your hat, your trick is to predict the color of the last marble.\n \n Note: A magician may confuse your eyes, but not your mind ;-)\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `b`\n\n  Initial number of black marbles in the hat. \n  \n  `1 <= b <= 10^9`\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `w`\n\n  Initial number of white marbles in the hat. \n  \n  `1 <= w <= 10^9`\n\n\n - `[output]` a string\n\n  `\"Black\"` or `\"White\"` if you can safely predict the color of the last marble. If not, return `\"Unsure\"`.",
