    "question": "Prior to having fancy iPhones, teenagers would wear out their thumbs sending SMS\nmessages on candybar-shaped feature phones with 3x4 numeric keypads.\n\n    ------- ------- -------\n    |     | | ABC | | DEF |\n    |  1  | |  2  | |  3  |\n    ------- ------- -------\n    ------- ------- -------\n    | GHI | | JKL | | MNO |\n    |  4  | |  5  | |  6  |\n    ------- ------- -------\n    ------- ------- -------\n    |PQRS | | TUV | | WXYZ|\n    |  7  | |  8  | |  9  |\n    ------- ------- -------\n    ------- ------- -------\n    |     | |space| |     |\n    |  *  | |  0  | |  #  |\n    ------- ------- -------\n\nPrior to the development of T9 (predictive text entry) systems, the method to\ntype words was called \"multi-tap\" and involved pressing a button repeatedly to\ncycle through the possible values.\n\nFor example, to type a letter `\"R\"` you would press the `7` key three times (as\nthe screen display for the current character cycles through `P->Q->R->S->7`).  A\ncharacter is \"locked in\" once the user presses a different key or pauses for a\nshort period of time (thus, no extra button presses are required beyond what is\nneeded for each letter individually). The zero key handles spaces, with one press of the key producing a space and two presses producing a zero.\n\nIn order to send the message `\"WHERE DO U WANT 2 MEET L8R\"` a teen would have to\nactually do 47 button presses.  No wonder they abbreviated.\n\nFor this assignment, write a module that can calculate the amount of button\npresses required for any phrase. Punctuation can be ignored for this exercise. Likewise, you can assume the phone doesn't distinguish between upper/lowercase characters (but you should allow your module to accept input in either for convenience).\n\nHint: While it wouldn't take too long to hard code the amount of keypresses for\nall 26 letters by hand, try to avoid doing so! (Imagine you work at a phone\nmanufacturer who might be testing out different keyboard layouts, and you want\nto be able to test new ones rapidly.)",
