    "question": "Imagine there's a big cube consisting of n^3 small cubes. Calculate, how many small cubes are not visible from outside.\n\nFor example, if we have a cube which has 4 cubes in a row, then the function should return 8, because there are 8 cubes inside our cube (2 cubes in each dimension)",
