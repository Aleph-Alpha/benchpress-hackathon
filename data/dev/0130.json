    "question": "**Step 1:** Create a function called `encode()` to replace all the lowercase vowels in a given string with numbers according to the following pattern:\n```\na -> 1\ne -> 2\ni -> 3\no -> 4\nu -> 5\n```\n\nFor example, `encode(\"hello\")` would return `\"h2ll4\"`. There is no need to worry about uppercase vowels in this kata.\n\n**Step 2:** Now create a function called `decode()` to turn the numbers back into vowels according to the same pattern shown above.\n\nFor example, `decode(\"h3 th2r2\")` would return `\"hi there\"`.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, you can assume that any numbers passed into the function will correspond to vowels.",
