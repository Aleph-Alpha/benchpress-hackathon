    "question": "### Background\n\nWe **all** know about \"balancing parentheses\" (plus brackets, braces and chevrons) and even balancing characters that are identical.  \n\nRead that last sentence again, I balanced different characters and identical characters twice and you didn't even notice... :)\n\n### Kata\nYour challenge in this kata is to write a piece of code to validate that a supplied string is balanced.\n\nYou must determine if all that is open is then closed, and nothing is closed which is not already open!\n\nYou will be given a string to validate, and a second string, where each pair of characters defines an opening and closing sequence that needs balancing.\n\nYou may assume that the second string always has an even number of characters.\n\n### Example\n```python\n# In this case '(' opens a section, and ')' closes a section\nis_balanced(\"(Sensei says yes!)\", \"()\")       # => True\nis_balanced(\"(Sensei says no!\", \"()\")         # => False\n\n# In this case '(' and '[' open a section, while ')' and ']' close a section\nis_balanced(\"(Sensei [says] yes!)\", \"()[]\")   # => True\nis_balanced(\"(Sensei [says) no!]\", \"()[]\")    # => False\n\n# In this case a single quote (') both opens and closes a section\nis_balanced(\"Sensei says 'yes'!\", \"''\")       # => True\nis_balanced(\"Sensei say's no!\", \"''\")         # => False\n```",
