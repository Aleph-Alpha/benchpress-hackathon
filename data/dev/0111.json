    "question": "Complete the function, which calculates how much you need to tip based on the total amount of the bill and the service. \n\nYou need to consider the following ratings:\n\n- Terrible: tip 0%\n- Poor: tip 5%\n- Good: tip 10%\n- Great: tip 15%\n- Excellent: tip 20%\n\nThe rating is **case insensitive** (so \"great\" = \"GREAT\"). If an unrecognised rating is received, then you need to return:\n\n* `\"Rating not recognised\"` in Javascript, Python and Ruby...\n* ...or `null` in Java\n* ...or `-1` in C#\n\nBecause you're a nice person, you **always round up** the tip, regardless of the service.",
