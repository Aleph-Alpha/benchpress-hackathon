    "question": "Everyone Knows AdFly and their Sister Sites.\n\nIf we see the Page Source of an ad.fly site we can see this perticular line:\nBelieve it or not This is actually the Encoded url which you would skip to.\n\nThe Algorithm is as Follows:\n```\n1) The ysmm value is broken like this\n\nysmm   = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  = \"0123456789\"\ncode1  = 0   2   4   6   8    = \"02468\"\ncode2  =   9   7   5   3   1  = \"97531\"\n\n2) code1+code2 is base64 Decoded\n\n3) The result will be of this form :\nhttps://adf.ly/go.php?u=\n\n4)  has to be further decoded and the result is to be returned\n```\n\nYour Task:\n\n```\nMake a function to Encode text to ysmm value.\n\nand a function to Decode ysmm value.\n```\n\nNote: Take random values for The first 2 int values.\nI personally hate trivial error checking like giving integer input in place of string. \n\n```\nInput For Decoder & Encoder: Strings\nReturn \"Invalid\" for invalid Strings\n```",
