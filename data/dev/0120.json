    "question": "Our fruit guy has a bag of fruit (represented as an array of strings) where some fruits are rotten. He wants to replace all the rotten pieces of fruit with fresh ones. For example, given `[\"apple\",\"rottenBanana\",\"apple\"]` the replaced array should be `[\"apple\",\"banana\",\"apple\"]`. Your task is to implement a method that accepts an array of strings containing fruits should returns an array of strings where all the rotten fruits are replaced by good ones. \n\n### Notes\n\n- If the array is null/nil/None or empty you should return empty array (`[]`).\n- The rotten fruit name will be in this camelcase (`rottenFruit`).\n- The returned array should be in lowercase.",
