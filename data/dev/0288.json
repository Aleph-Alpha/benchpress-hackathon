    "question": "Take an integer `n (n >= 0)` and a digit `d (0 <= d <= 9)` as an integer. Square all numbers `k (0 <= k <= n)` between 0 and n. Count the numbers of \ndigits `d` used in the writing of all the `k**2`. Call `nb_dig` (or nbDig or ...) the function taking `n` and `d` as parameters and returning this count.\n\n#Examples:\n```\nn = 10, d = 1, the k*k are 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100\nWe are using the digit 1 in 1, 16, 81, 100. The total count is then 4.\n\nnb_dig(25, 1):\nthe numbers of interest are\n1, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 21 which squared are 1, 16, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 361, 441\nso there are 11 digits `1` for the squares of numbers between 0 and 25.\n```\nNote that `121` has twice the digit `1`.",
