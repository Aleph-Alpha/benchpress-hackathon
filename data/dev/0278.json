    "question": "A new task for you!\n\nYou have to create a method, that corrects a given time string.\nThere was a problem in addition, so many of the time strings are broken.\nTime-Format is european. So from \"00:00:00\" to \"23:59:59\".\n\n\nSome examples:\n\n\"09:10:01\" -> \"09:10:01\"\n\"11:70:10\" -> \"12:10:10\"\n\"19:99:99\" -> \"20:40:39\"\n\"24:01:01\" -> \"00:01:01\"\n\nIf the input-string is null or empty return exactly this value! (empty string for C++)\nIf the time-string-format is invalid, return null. (empty string for C++)\n\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\nI have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.",
