    "question": "An NBA game runs 48 minutes (Four 12 minute quarters). Players do not typically play the full game, subbing in and out as necessary. Your job is to extrapolate a player's points per game if they played the full 48 minutes.\n\nWrite a function that takes two arguments, ppg (points per game) and mpg (minutes per game) and returns a straight extrapolation of ppg per 48 minutes rounded to the nearest tenth. Return 0 if 0.\n\nExamples:\n```python\nnba_extrap(12, 20) # 28.8\nnba_extrap(10, 10) # 48\nnba_extrap(5, 17) # 14.1\nnba_extrap(0, 0) # 0\n```\n\nNotes:\nAll inputs will be either be an integer or float.\nFollow your dreams!",
