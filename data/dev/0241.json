    "question": "I'm sure you're familiar with factorials \u2013 that is, the product of an integer and all the integers below it. \n\nFor example, `5! = 120`, as `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`\n\nYour challenge is to create a function that takes any number and returns the number that it is a factorial of. So, if your function receives `120`, it should return `\"5!\"` (as a string).\n\nOf course, not every number is a factorial of another. In this case, your function would return `\"None\"` (as a string).\n\n### Examples\n\n* `120` will return `\"5!\"`\n* `24` will return `\"4!\"`\n* `150` will return `\"None\"`",
