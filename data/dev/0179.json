Also note that the pair cannot include the same element of the array twice (however, if there are two equal elements in the array, they can form a pair).\n\n# Example\n\n For `arr = [\"abc\", \"aaa\", \"aba\", \"bab\"]` and `result = \"bbb\"`, the output should be `2`.\n\n ```\n\"abc\" and \"bab\" can crossover to \"bbb\"\n\"aba\" and \"bab\" can crossover to \"bbb\"\n```\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` string array `arr`\n\n   A non-empty array of equal-length strings.\n\n   Constraints: `2 \u2264 arr.length \u2264 10, 1 \u2264 arr[i].length \u2264 10.`\n\n\n - `[input]` string `result`\n\n   A string of the same length as each of the arr elements.\n\n   Constraints: `result.length = arr[i].length.`\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer",
