    "question": "# Pythagorean Triples\n\nA Pythagorean triplet is a set of three numbers a, b, and c where `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`. In this Kata, you will be tasked with finding the Pythagorean triplets whose product is equal to `n`, the given argument to the function `pythagorean_triplet`.\n\n## Your task\n\nIn this Kata, you will be tasked with finding the Pythagorean triplets whose product is equal to `n`, the given argument to the function, where `0 < n < 10000000`\n\n\n## Examples\n\nOne such triple is `3, 4, 5`. For this challenge, you would be given the value `60` as the argument to your function, and then it would return the Pythagorean triplet in an array `[3, 4, 5]` which is returned in increasing order. `3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2` since `9 + 16 = 25` and then their product (`3 * 4 * 5`) is `60`.\n\n\nMore examples:\n\n| **argument** | **returns** |\n| ---------|---------|\n| 60       | [3, 4, 5] |\n| 780      | [5, 12, 13] |\n| 2040     | [8, 15, 17] |",
