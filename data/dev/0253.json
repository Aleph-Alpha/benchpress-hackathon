    "question": "You are going to be given a string. Your job is to return that string in a certain order that I will explain below:\n\nLet's say you start with this: `012345`\n\nThe first thing you do is reverse it:`543210`  \nThen you will take the string from the 1st position and reverse it again:`501234`  \nThen you will take the string from the 2nd position and reverse it again:`504321`  \nThen you will take the string from the 3rd position and reverse it again:`504123`\n\nContinue this pattern until you have done every single position, and then you will return the string you have created. For this particular number, you would return:`504132`\n\n#Input:\nA string of length 1 - 1000\n\n#Output:\nA correctly reordered string.",
