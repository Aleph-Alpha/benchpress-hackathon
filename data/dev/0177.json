Even if the sound is found mid word (like in octopus) or not in lowercase grandma still thinks that should be replaced with a 2. Bless her.\n\n```text\n'I love to text' becomes 'I love 2 text'\n'see you tomorrow' becomes 'see you 2morrow'\n'look at that octopus' becomes 'look at that oc2pus'\n```\n\nNote that 'too' should become '2', not '2o'",
