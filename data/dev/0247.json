    "question": "As a treat, I'll let you read part of the script from a classic 'I'm Alan Partridge episode:\n```\nLynn: Alan, there\u2019s that teacher chap.\nAlan: Michael, if he hits me, will you hit him first?\nMichael: No, he\u2019s a customer. I cannot hit customers. I\u2019ve been told. I\u2019ll go and get some stock.\nAlan: Yeah, chicken stock.\nPhil: Hello Alan.\nAlan: Lynn, hand me an apple pie. And remove yourself from the theatre of conflict.\nLynn: What do you mean?\nAlan: Go and stand by the yakults. The temperature inside this apple turnover is 1,000 degrees. If I squeeze it, a jet of molten Bramley apple is going to squirt out. Could go your way, could go mine. Either way, one of us is going down.\n```\n\nAlan is known for referring to the temperature of the apple turnover as 'Hotter than the sun!'. According to  space.com the temperature of the sun's corona is 2,000,000 degrees C, but we will ignore the science for now. \n\nYour job is simple, if (x) squared is more than 1000, return  'It's hotter than the sun!!', else, return 'Help yourself to a honeycomb Yorkie for the glovebox.'.\n\nX will be either a number or a string. Both are valid. \n\nOther katas in this series:\nAlan Partridge I - Partridge Watch\nAlan Partridge III - London",
