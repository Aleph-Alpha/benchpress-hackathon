    "question": "Your wizard cousin works at a Quidditch stadium and wants you to write a function that calculates the points for the Quidditch scoreboard! \n\n# Story\n\nQuidditch is a sport with two teams. The teams score goals by throwing the Quaffle through a hoop, each goal is worth **10 points**.\n\nThe referee also deducts 30 points (**- 30 points**) from the team who are guilty of carrying out any of these fouls: Blatching, Blurting, Bumphing, Haverstacking, Quaffle-pocking, Stooging \n\nThe match is concluded when the Snitch is caught, and catching the Snitch is worth **150 points**. Let's say a Quaffle goes through the hoop just seconds after the Snitch is caught, in that case the points of that goal should not end up on the scoreboard seeing as the match is already concluded. \n\nYou don't need any prior knowledge of how Quidditch works in order to complete this kata, but if you want to read up on what it is, here's a link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch\n\n# Task\n\nYou will be given a string with two arguments, the first argument will tell you which teams are playing and the second argument tells you what's happened in the match. Calculate the points and return a string containing the teams final scores, with the team names sorted in the same order as in the first argument. \n\n# Examples:\n\n# Given an input of:\n\n# The expected output would be:\n\nSeparate the team names from their respective points with a colon and separate the two teams with a comma. \n\nGood luck!",
