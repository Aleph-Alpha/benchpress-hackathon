    "question": "In this Kata you are expected to find the coefficients of quadratic equation of the given two roots (`x1` and `x2`).\n\nEquation will be the form of ```ax^2 + bx + c = 0```\n\nReturn type is a Vector (tuple in Rust, Array in Ruby) containing coefficients of the equations in the order `(a, b, c)`.\n\nSince there are infinitely many solutions to this problem, we fix `a = 1`.\n\nRemember, the roots can be written like `(x-x1) * (x-x2) = 0`\n\n### Example \n\n    quadratic(1,2) = (1, -3, 2)\n\nThis means `(x-1) * (x-2) = 0`; when we do the multiplication this becomes `x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0`\n\n### Example 2\n\n    quadratic(0,1) = (1, -1, 0)\n\nThis means `(x-0) * (x-1) = 0`; when we do the multiplication this becomes `x^2 - x + 0 = 0`\n\n### Notes\n\n* Inputs will be integers.\n* When `x1 == x2`, this means the root has the multiplicity of two",
