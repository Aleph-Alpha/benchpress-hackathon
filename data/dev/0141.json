    "question": "# Task\n\nJohn won the championship of a TV show. He can get some bonuses.\n\nHe needs to play a game to determine the amount of his bonus.\n\nHere are some cards in a row. A number is written on each card.\n\nIn each turn, John can take a card, but only from the beginning or the end of the row. Then multiply the number on the card by an coefficient 2^(i)(i means the ith turn). The product is John's bonus of current turn.\n\nAfter all the cards are taken away, the game is over. John's final bonus is the sum of all rounds of bonuses.\n\nObviously, the order in which John takes the cards will affect the amount of John's final bonus.\n\nYour task is to help John calculate the maximum amount of bonuses he can get.\n\n# Input\n\n- `cards`: An integer array. Each element represents the number on the card.\n  - `1 <= cards.length <= 30`\n  - `1 <= cards[i] <= 100`\n\n\n- All inputs are valid.\n\n# Output\n\nAn integer. the maximum amount of bonuses John can get.\n\n# Eaxmple\n\nFor `cards=[1,2,5]`, the output should be `50`.\n\n```\nAll possible orders are:\n1->2->5   bonus:1x2+2*4+5*8=50\n1->5->2   bonus:1x2+5*4+2*8=38\n5->1->2   bonus:5*2+1*4+2*8=30\n5->2->1   bonus:5*2+2*4+1*8=26\nThe maximum amount of bonus is 50.\n```",
