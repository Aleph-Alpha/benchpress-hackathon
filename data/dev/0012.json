    "question": "We have the number ```12385```. We want to know the value of the closest cube but higher than 12385. The answer will be ```13824```.\n\nNow, another case. We have the number ```1245678```. We want to know the 5th power, closest and higher than that number. The value will be ```1419857```.\n\nWe need a function ```find_next_power``` ( ```findNextPower``` in JavaScript, CoffeeScript and Haskell), that receives two arguments, a value ```val```, and the exponent of the power,``` pow_```, and outputs the value that we want to find.\n\nLet'see some cases:\n```python\nfind_next_power(12385, 3) == 13824\n\nfind_next_power(1245678, 5) == 1419857\n```\nThe value, ```val``` will be always a positive integer.\n\nThe power, ```pow_```, always higher than ```1```.\n\nHappy coding!!",
