    "question": "Program a function `sumAverage(arr)` where `arr` is an array containing arrays full of numbers, for example:\n\n```python\nsum_average([[1, 2, 2, 1], [2, 2, 2, 1]])\n```\n\nFirst, determine the average of each array. Then, return the sum of all the averages.\n\n- All numbers will be less than 100 and greater than -100.\n- `arr` will contain a maximum of 50 arrays.\n- After calculating all the averages, add them **all** together, **then** round down, as shown in the example below:\n\nThe example given: `sumAverage([[3, 4, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4], [21, 54, 33, 21, 77]])`, the answer being 44.\n1. Calculate the average of each individual array:\n```\n[3, 4, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4] = (3 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4) / 7 = 3\n[21, 54, 33, 21, 77] = (21 + 54 + 33 + 21 + 77) / 5 = 41.2\n```\n2. Add the average of each array together:\n```\n3 + 41.2 = 44.2\n```\n3. Round the final average down:\n\n~~~if:julia\nIn Julia, the `Statistics` package is preloaded.\n~~~\n```python\nimport math\nmath.floor(44.2) = 44\n```",
