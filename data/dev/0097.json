    "question": "# The museum of incredible dull things\n\nThe museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.\n\nHowever, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.\n\n# Task\n\nGiven an array of integers, remove the smallest value. **Do not mutate the original array/list**. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.\n\nDon't change the order of the elements that are left.\n\n### Examples\n\n```python\nremove_smallest([1,2,3,4,5]) = [2,3,4,5]\nremove_smallest([5,3,2,1,4]) = [5,3,2,4]\nremove_smallest([2,2,1,2,1]) = [2,2,2,1]\n```",
