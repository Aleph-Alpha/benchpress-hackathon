If the value before the most recent left choice was *l/m* and the value before the most recent right choice\nwas r/s then the new value will be *(l+r) / (m+s)*. \n\nIf there has never been a left choice we use *l=1* and *m=0*;  \nif there has never been a right choice we use *r=0* and *s=1*.\n\n\nSo let's take a walk.\n\n* `\"\"` An empty promenade has never had a left choice nor a right choice. Therefore we use *(l=1 and m=0)* and *(r=0 and s=1)*.  \nSo the value of `\"\"` is *(1+0) / (0+1) = 1/1*.\n* `\"L\"`. Before the most recent left choice we have `\"\"`, which equals *1/1*. There still has never been a right choice, so *(r=0 and s=1)*. So the value of `\"L\"` is *(1+0)/(1+1) = 1/2*\n* `\"LR\"` = 2/3 as we use the values of `\"\"` (before the left choice) and `\"L\"` (before the right choice)\n* `\"LRL\"` = 3/5 as we use the values of `\"LR\"` and `\"L\"`\n* `\"LRLL\"` = 4/7 as we use the values of `\"LRL\"` and `\"L\"` \n\n\nFractions are allowed to have a larger than b.\n\n\n## Your task\n\nImplement the `promenade` function, which takes an promenade as input (represented as a string), and returns \nthe corresponding fraction (represented as a tuple, containing the numerator and the denominator).\n\n```Python\npromenade(\"\") == (1,1)\npromenade(\"LR\") == (2,3)\npromenade(\"LRLL\") == (4,7)\n```\n```Java\nReturn the Fraction as an int-Array:\npromenade(\"\") == [1,1]\npromenade(\"LR\") == [2,3]\npromenade(\"LRLL\") == [4,7]\n```\n\n\n*adapted from the 2016 British Informatics Olympiad*",
