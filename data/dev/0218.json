The function returns a string of the same length with each word reversed, but still in their original order.\n\n```python\nreverse_sentence(\"Hello !Nhoj Want to have lunch?\") # \"olleH johN! tnaW ot evah ?hcnul\"\n```\nNote:  \nA \"word\" should be considered a string split by a space character, \" \"\nLetter capitalization should be maintained.",
