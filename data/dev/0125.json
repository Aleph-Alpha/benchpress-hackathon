    "question": "This kata is  blatantly copied from  inspired by This Kata\nWelcome\n\nthis is the second in the series of the string iterations kata!\n\nHere we go!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have a string s\n\nLet's say you start with this: \"String\"\n\nThe first thing you do is reverse it: \"gnirtS\"\n\nThen you will take the string from the 1st position and reverse it again: \"gStrin\"\n\nThen you will take the string from the 2nd position and reverse it again: \"gSnirt\"\n\nThen you will take the string from the 3rd position and reverse it again: \"gSntri\"\n\nContinue this pattern until you have done every single position, and then you will return the string you have created. For this particular string, you would return: \n\"gSntir\"\n\nnow,\n\nThe Task:\n\nIn this kata, we also have a number x\n\ntake that reversal function, and apply it to the string x times.\n\n\nreturn the result of the string after applying the reversal function to it x times.\n\n    example where s = \"String\" and x = 3:\n\n    after 0 iteration  s = \"String\"\n    after 1 iteration  s = \"gSntir\"\n    after 2 iterations s = \"rgiStn\"\n    after 3 iterations s = \"nrtgSi\"\n    \n    so you would return \"nrtgSi\".\n\n Note \n\nString lengths may exceed 2 million\n\n\nx exceeds a billion\n\n\nbe read to optimize\n\n\n\nif this is too hard, go here https://www.codewars.com/kata/string-%3E-n-iterations-%3E-string/java",
