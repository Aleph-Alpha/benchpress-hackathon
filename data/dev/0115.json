    "question": "In this Kata, you will check if it is possible to convert a string to a palindrome by changing one character. \n\nFor instance:\n```Haskell\nsolve (\"abbx\") = True, because we can convert 'x' to 'a' and get a palindrome. \nsolve (\"abba\") = False, because we cannot get a palindrome by changing any character. \nsolve (\"abcba\") = True. We can change the middle character. \nsolve (\"aa\") = False \nsolve (\"ab\") = True\n```\n\nGood luck!\n\nPlease also try [Single Character Palindromes](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a2c22271f7f709eaa0005d3)",
