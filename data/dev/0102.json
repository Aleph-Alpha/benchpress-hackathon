The higher the number the higher the points.  \nIn the array [1,3,2] 3 is the highest point value so it gets 1st place. 2 is the second highest so it gets second place. 1 is the 3rd highest so it gets 3rd place. \n\nYour task is to return an array giving each number its rank in the array.  \ninput // [1,3,2] \noutput // [3,1,2]\n\n```rankings([1,2,3,4,5]) // [5,4,3,2,1]``` \n```rankings([3,4,1,2,5])//  [3,2,5,4,1]``` \n```rankings([10,20,40,50,30]) //  [5, 4, 2, 1, 3]``` \n```rankings([1, 10]) //   [2, 1]``` \n```rankings([22, 33, 18, 9, 110, 4, 1, 88, 6, 50]) //```\n```[5, 4, 6, 7, 1, 9, 10, 2, 8, 3]```",
