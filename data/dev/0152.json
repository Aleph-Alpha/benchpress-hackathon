Purchases of 2 or more litres get a discount of 5 cents per litre, purchases of 4 or more litres get a discount of 10 cents per litre, and so on every two litres, up to a maximum discount of 25 cents per litre. But total discount per litre cannot be more than 25 cents. Return the toal cost rounded to 2 decimal places. Also you can guess that there will not be negative or non-numeric inputs.\n\nGood Luck!\n```\n\n```if:csharp,java,javascript\nIn this kata you will have to write a function that takes `litres` and `pricePerLitre` as arguments.
