    "question": "In this Kata, we are going to reverse a string while maintaining the spaces (if any) in their original place.\n\nFor example:\n```\nsolve(\"our code\") = \"edo cruo\"\n-- Normal reversal without spaces is \"edocruo\". \n-- However, there is a space at index 3, so the string becomes \"edo cruo\"\n\nsolve(\"your code rocks\") = \"skco redo cruoy\". \nsolve(\"codewars\") = \"srawedoc\"\n```\nMore examples in the test cases. All input will be lower case letters and in some cases spaces.\n\nGood luck!\n\nPlease also try:\n\n[Simple time difference](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b76a34ff71e5de9db0000f2)\n\n[Simple remove duplicates](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5ba38ba180824a86850000f7)",
