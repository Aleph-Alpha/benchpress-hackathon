    "question": "You have to create a function which receives 3 arguments: 2 numbers, and the result of an unknown operation performed on them (also a number).\n\nBased on those 3 values you have to return a string, that describes which operation was used to get the given result.\n\nThe possible return strings are:\n  `\"addition\"`,\n  `\"subtraction\"`,\n  `\"multiplication\"`,\n  `\"division\"`.\n\n## Example:\n```\ncalcType(1, 2, 3) -->   1 ? 2 = 3   --> \"addition\"\n```\n\n## Notes\n* In case of division you should expect that the result of the operation is obtained by using `/` operator on the input values - no manual data type conversion or rounding should be performed.\n* Cases with just one possible answers are generated.\n* Only valid arguments will be passed to the function.",
