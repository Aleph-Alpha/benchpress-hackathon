    "question": "Due to another of his misbehaved, \nthe primary school's teacher of the young Gau\u00df,  Herr J.G. B\u00fcttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he teaching arithmetic to his mates,\nassigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number `n`.\n\nYour task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.\n\nHere's, an example:\n\n```\nf(n=100) // returns 5050 \n```\n\nIt's your duty to verify that n is a valid positive integer number. If not, please, return false (None for Python, null for C#).\n\n> **Note:** the goal of this kata is to invite you to think about some 'basic' mathematic formula and how you can do performance optimization on your code. \n\n> Advanced - experienced users should try to solve it in one line, without loops, or optimizing the code as much as they can.\n\n-----\n\n**Credits:** this kata was inspired by the farzher's kata 'Sum of large ints' . In fact, it can be seen as a sort of prep kata for that one.",
