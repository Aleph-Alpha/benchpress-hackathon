    "question": "You need to play around with the provided string (s).\n\nMove consonants forward 9 places through the alphabet.\nIf they pass 'z', start again at 'a'.\n\nMove vowels back 5 places through the alphabet.\nIf they pass 'a', start again at 'z'.\nFor our Polish friends this kata does not count 'y' as a vowel.\n\nExceptions:\n\nIf the character is 'c' or 'o', move it back 1 place.\nFor 'd' move it back 3, and for 'e', move it back 4.\n\nIf a moved letter becomes 'c', 'o', 'd' or 'e', revert it back to it's original value.\n\nProvided string will always be lower case, won't be empty and will have no special characters.",
