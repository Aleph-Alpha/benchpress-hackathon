    "question": "In this Kata, we will check if a string contains consecutive letters as they appear in the English alphabet and if each letter occurs only once. \n\n```Haskell\nRules are: (1) the letters are adjacent in the English alphabet, and (2) each letter occurs only once.\n\nFor example: \nsolve(\"abc\") = True, because it contains a,b,c\nsolve(\"abd\") = False, because a, b, d are not consecutive/adjacent in the alphabet, and c is missing.\nsolve(\"dabc\") = True, because it contains a, b, c, d\nsolve(\"abbc\") = False, because b does not occur once.\nsolve(\"v\") = True\n```\nAll inputs will be lowercase letters. \n\nMore examples in test cases. Good luck!",
