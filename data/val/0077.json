    "question": "In his publication Liber Abaci Leonardo Bonacci, aka Fibonacci, posed a problem involving a population of idealized rabbits. These rabbits bred at a fixed rate, matured over the course of one month, had unlimited resources, and were immortal.\n\nBeginning with one immature pair of these idealized rabbits that produce b pairs of offspring at the end of each month. Create a function that determines the number of pair of mature rabbits after n months.\n\nTo illustrate the problem, consider the following example:\n\n```python\nfib_rabbits(5, 3) returns 19\n```\n\n\n\n\nMonth\nImmature Pairs\nAdult Pairs\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n2\n3\n1\n\n\n3\n3\n4\n\n\n4\n12\n7\n\n\n5\n21\n19\n\n\n\n                                \n        \nHint: any Fibonacci number can be computed using the following equation Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2)",
