    "question": "You have a set of four (4) balls labeled with different numbers: ball_1 (1), ball_2 (2), ball_3 (3) and ball(4) and we have 3 equal boxes for distribute them. The possible combinations of the balls, without having empty boxes, are:\n\n```\n (1)            (2)        (3)(4)     \n______        ______       _______ \n    \n```\n\n```\n (1)           (2)(4)        (3)\n______         ______      ______\n  \n```\n\n```\n(1)(4)           (2)         (3)\n______          ______      ______\n\n```\n\n```\n  (1)           (2)(3)       (4)\n_______         _______     ______\n\n```\n\n```\n(1)(3)            (2)        (4)\n_______         _______     ______\n```\n\n```\n(1)(2)            (3)        (4)\n_______         _______     ______\n```\nWe have a total of **6** combinations.\n\nThink how many combinations you will have with two boxes instead of three. You will obtain **7** combinations.\n\nObviously, the four balls in only box will give only one possible combination (the four balls in the unique box). Another particular case is the four balls in four boxes having again one possible combination(Each box having one ball).\n\nWhat will be the reasonable result for a set of n elements with no boxes?\n\nThink to create a function that may calculate the amount of these combinations of a set of ```n``` elements in ```k``` boxes.\n\nYou do no not have to check the inputs type that will be always valid integers.\n\nThe code should detect the cases when ```k > n```, returning \"It cannot be possible!\". \n\nFeatures of the random tests:\n```\n1 <= k <= n <= 800\n```\nRuby version will be published soon.",
