    "question": "Create a function that finds the [integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral) of the expression passed.\n\nIn order to find the integral all you need to do is add one to the `exponent` (the second argument), and divide the `coefficient` (the first argument) by that new number.\n\nFor example for `3x^2`, the integral would be `1x^3`: we added 1 to the exponent, and divided the coefficient by that new number).\n\nNotes:\n* The output should be a string.\n* The coefficient and exponent is always a positive integer.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n 3, 2  -->  \"1x^3\"\n12, 5  -->  \"2x^6\"\n20, 1  -->  \"10x^2\"\n40, 3  -->  \"10x^4\"\n90, 2  -->  \"30x^3\"\n```",
