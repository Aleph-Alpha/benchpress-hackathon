    "question": "Given an D-dimension array, where each axis is of length N, your goal is to find the sum of every index in the array starting from 0.\n\nFor Example if D=1 and N=10 then the answer would be 45 ([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])\nIf D=2 and N = 3 the answer is 18 which would be the sum of every number in the following:\n```python\n[\n[(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)],\n[(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)],\n[(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]\n]\n```\n\nA naive solution could be to loop over every index in every dimension and add to a global sum. This won't work as the number of dimension is expected to be quite large.\n\nHint: A formulaic approach would be best\nHint 2: Gauss could solve the one dimensional case in his earliest of years, This is just a generalization.\n\n~~~if:javascript\nNote for JS version: Because the results will exceed the maximum safe integer easily, for such values you're only required to have a precision of at least `1 in 1e-9` to the actual answer.\n~~~",
