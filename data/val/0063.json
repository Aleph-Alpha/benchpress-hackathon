One type of pill makes a person glow about 30 minutes after taking and none of the other types has any effect.\nHis job is to determine, in which jar are the pills that make a person glow.\nBut there is one catch, he only has 35 minutes to do so.(so he can't take a pill, wait for the results and then take another one, because he wouldn't be able to see the results)\nFortunetely, he can take any number of friends he needs with him.\nOn completing the task Andrzej receives one million dollars. You know that Andrzej is very honest, so he will split the money equally with his friends.\nYour job is to determine how many friends does Andrzej need to complete the task.(He also wants to make the highest amount of money.)\nFor example for n = 2\nThe answer is 0 because he doesn't need any friends, he just needs to take a pill from the first jar and wait for the effects.\nFor another example for n = 4\nThe answer is 1 because having pills A B C D Andrzej can take pills A B and the friend can take pills B C",
