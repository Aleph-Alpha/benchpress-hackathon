    "question": "John has some amount of money of which he wants to deposit a part `f0` to the bank at the beginning\nof year `1`. He wants to withdraw each year for his living an amount `c0`.\n\nHere is his banker plan:\n\n- deposit `f0` at beginning of year 1\n- his bank account has an interest rate of `p` percent per year, constant over the years\n- John can withdraw each year `c0`, taking it whenever he wants in the year; he must take account of an inflation of `i` percent per year in order to keep his quality of living. `i` is supposed to stay constant over the years.\n- all amounts f0..fn-1, c0..cn-1 are truncated by the bank to their integral part\n- Given f0, `p`, c0, `i` \nthe banker guarantees that John will be able to go on that way until the `nth` year.\n\n# Example:\n\n```\nf0 = 100000, p = 1 percent, c0 = 2000, n = 15, i = 1 percent\n```\n\n```\nbeginning of year 2 -> f1 = 100000 + 0.01*100000 - 2000 = 99000;  c1 = c0 + c0*0.01 = 2020 (with inflation of previous year)\n```\n\n```\nbeginning of year 3 -> f2 =  99000 + 0.01*99000 - 2020  = 97970;  c2 = c1 + c1*0.01 = 2040.20 \n(with inflation of previous year, truncated to 2040)\n```\n\n```\nbeginning of year 4 -> f3 =  97970 + 0.01*97970 - 2040  = 96909.7 (truncated to 96909); \nc3 = c2 + c2*0.01 = 2060.4 (with inflation of previous year, truncated to 2060)\n```\nand so on...\n\nJohn wants to know if the banker's plan is right or wrong.\nGiven parameters `f0, p, c0, n, i` build a function `fortune` which returns `true` if John can make a living until the `nth` year\nand `false` if it is not possible.\n\n# Some cases:\n```\nfortune(100000, 1, 2000, 15, 1) -> True\nfortune(100000, 1, 10000, 10, 1) -> True\nfortune(100000, 1, 9185, 12, 1) -> False\n\nFor the last case you can find below the amounts of his account at the beginning of each year:\n100000, 91815, 83457, 74923, 66211, 57318, 48241, 38977, 29523, 19877, 10035, -5\n```\nf11 = -5 so he has no way to withdraw something for his living in year 12.\n\n> **Note:** Don't forget to convert the percent parameters as percentages in the body of your function: if a parameter percent is 2 you have to convert it to 0.02.",
