An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim side by side. You can see the 1-, 2- and 3-interesting polygons in the picture below.\n\n ![](https://files.gitter.im/myjinxin2015/Gwsw/blob)\n\n# Example\n\n For `n = 1`, the output should be `1`;\n \n For `n = 2`, the output should be `5`;\n \n For `n = 3`, the output should be `13`.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer `n`\n\n    Constraints: `1 \u2264 n < 10000.`\n    \n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n   The area of the n-interesting polygon.",
