    "question": "You get a \"text\" and have to shift the vowels by \"n\" positions to the right.\n(Negative value for n should shift to the left.)\n\"Position\" means the vowel's position if taken as one item in a list of all vowels within the string.\nA shift by 1 would mean, that every vowel shifts to the place of the next vowel.\nShifting over the edges of the text should continue at the other edge.\n\nExample:\n\ntext = \"This is a test!\"\nn = 1\noutput = \"Thes is i tast!\"\n\ntext = \"This is a test!\"\nn = 3\noutput = \"This as e tist!\"\n\nIf text is null or empty return exactly this value.\nVowels are \"a,e,i,o,u\".\n\n\n\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)\n\nI have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.",
