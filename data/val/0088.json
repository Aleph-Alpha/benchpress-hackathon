    "question": "# Task\n\nJohn has an important number, and he doesn't want others to see it.\n\nHe decided to encrypt the number, using the following steps:\n```\nHis number is always a non strict increasing sequence\nie. \"123\"\n\nHe converted each digit into English words.\nie. \"123\"--> \"ONETWOTHREE\"\n\nAnd then, rearrange the letters randomly.\nie. \"ONETWOTHREE\" --> \"TTONWOHREEE\"\n```\n\nJohn felt that his number were safe in doing so. In fact, such encryption can be easily decrypted :(\n\nGiven the encrypted string `s`, your task is to decrypt it, return the original number in string format.\n\nNote, You can assume that the input string `s` is always valid; It contains only uppercase Letters; The decrypted numbers are arranged in ascending order; The leading zeros are allowed.\n\n\n# Example\n\nFor `s = \"ONE\"`, the output should be `1`.\n\nFor `s = \"EON\"`, the output should be `1` too.\n\nFor `s = \"ONETWO\"`, the output should be `12`.\n\nFor `s = \"OONETW\"`, the output should be `12` too.\n\nFor `s = \"ONETWOTHREE\"`, the output should be `123`.\n\nFor `s = \"TTONWOHREEE\"`, the output should be `123` too.",
