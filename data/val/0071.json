You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer.\n\n Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.\n\n# Example\n\n For `arr = [5, 3, 6, 7, 9]`, the output should be `4`.\n\n Check out the image below for better understanding:\n\n \n\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n - `[input]` integer array `arr`\n\n    Non-empty array of positive integers.\n\n    Constraints: `1 \u2264 inputArray[i] \u2264 100.`\n\n\n - `[output]` an integer\n\n    The desired length.",
