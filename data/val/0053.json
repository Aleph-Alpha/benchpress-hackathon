    "question": "Given two strings, the first being a random string and the second being the same as the first, but with three added characters somewhere in the string (three same characters),\n\nWrite a function that returns the added character\n\n### E.g\n\n```\nstring1 = \"hello\"\nstring2 = \"aaahello\"\n\n// => 'a'\n```\n\nThe above is just an example; the characters could be anywhere in the string and string2 is actually **shuffled**.\n\n### Another example\n\n```\nstring1 = \"abcde\"\nstring2 = \"2db2a2ec\"\n\n// => '2'\n```\n\nNote that the added character could also exist in the original string\n\n\n```\nstring1 = \"aabbcc\"\nstring2 = \"aacccbbcc\"\n\n// => 'c'\n```\n\nYou can assume that string2 will aways be larger than string1, and there will always be three added characters in string2.\n\n```if:c\nWrite the function `added_char()` that takes two strings and return the added character as described above.\n```\n\n```if:javascript\nWrite the function `addedChar()` that takes two strings and return the added character as described above.\n```",
