    "question": "Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.\n\nThis function should take two arguments:\nexam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100);\nprojects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);\n\nThis function should return a number (final grade).\nThere are four types of final grades:\n- 100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.\n- 90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.\n- 75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.\n- 0, in other cases\n\nExamples:\n\n~~~if-not:nasm\n```python\nfinal_grade(100, 12)  # 100\nfinal_grade(99, 0)    # 100\nfinal_grade(10, 15)   # 100\nfinal_grade(85, 5)    # 90\nfinal_grade(55, 3)    # 75\nfinal_grade(55, 0)    # 0\nfinal_grade(20, 2)    # 0\n```\n~~~\n\n*Use Comparison and Logical Operators.",
