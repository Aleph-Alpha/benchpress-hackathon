    "question": "Consider a sequence made up of the consecutive prime numbers. This infinite sequence would start with: \n```python\n\"2357111317192329313741434753596167717379...\"\n```\n\nYou will be given two numbers: `a` and `b`, and your task will be to return `b` elements starting from index `a` in this sequence.\n```\nFor example:\nsolve(10,5) == `19232` Because these are 5 elements from index 10 in the sequence.\n```\n\nTests go up to about index `20000`.\n\nMore examples in test cases. Good luck!\n\nPlease also try [Simple time difference](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b76a34ff71e5de9db0000f2)",
