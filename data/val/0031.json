    "question": "# Task\n\nJohn and Alice have an appointment today. \n\nIn the morning, John starts from (`0,0`) and goes to the place (`a,b`) where he is dating. Unfortunately, John had no sense of direction at all, so he moved 1 step in a random direction(up, down, left or right) each time. For example, if John at (x,y), next step he may move to `(x+1,y), (x-1,y),(x,y+1) or (x,y-1)`. \n\nObviously, when he arrived at the destination, it was already too late and Alice had already left. It's a sadly story :(\n\nThe second day, Alice asked John why he didn't go to the dating place. John said he took `s` steps to his date yesterday.\n\nAlice wants to know whether John is lying. Please help Alice to judge.\n\nGiven two coordinates `a, b` and the step `s`, return `true` if John tells the truth, `false` otherwise.\n\n# Input/Output\n\n\n`[input]` integer `a`\n\nThe x-coordinates of the dating site.\n\n`-10^7 <= a <= 10^7`\n\n`[input]` integer `b`\n\nThe y-coordinates of the dating site.\n\n`-10^7 <= b <= 10^7`\n\n`[input]` integer `s`\n\nA positive integer.  The steps John using.\n\n`0 < s <= 10^9`\n\n`[output]` a boolean value\n\nreturn `true` if John tells the truth, `false` otherwise.\n\n# Example\n\nFor `a = 3, b = 3, s = 6`, the output should be `true`.\n\nA possible path is: \n\n`(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)`\n\nFor `a = 3, b = 3, s = 8`, the output should be `true`.\n\nA possible path is: \n\n`(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)`\n\nFor `a = 4, b = 5, s = 10`, the output should be `false`.\n\nJohn can't reach coordinates (a, b) using 10 steps, he's lying ;-)",
